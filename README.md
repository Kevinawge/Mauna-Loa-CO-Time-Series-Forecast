# Mauna Loa CO₂ Time Series Forecast

This project focuses on forecasting the monthly average CO₂ level at the Mauna Loa Observatory for April 2025. Using historical CO₂ measurements, our goal is to apply advanced time series modeling techniques to make accurate predictions of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.

Using models such as AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, and ETS, along with simulation-based approaches, to forecast CO₂ levels with a precision of two decimal places. The project includes constructing 95% and 99% prediction intervals to evaluate how well our models capture the true CO₂ value once it becomes available.
